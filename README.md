# Boho Auth

Boho Auth is a simple user-less authentication library for Next.js.

It is not intended to use as an authentication layer for an application. Rather, it's meant to be used to password protect pages, assets, or routes. 

It uses simple JWT to authenticate a visitor based on a password provided as an environment variable.
